# Equal Objects Should have Equal Hashcodes

# The better the developer you are the more abstract classes you should have

# Principles
## SOLID Principles



## Private and Static
Means if they are both there it cannot be over written

## Naming Classes
package ca.bcit.comp2601.lesson1.monikaszucs;
class Person {};
This means any class only in the package defined above can access this class

## Private Variables
class Person {
    private final String lastName;
};

This private variable is only accessible in this class. we add final if we dont plan on it having to change.

## Overriding
It is when you replace the parents method. 

## Interface
The children must override those methods in the interface

# Polymorphism is also sometimes called protocalls
